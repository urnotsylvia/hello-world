 Hi there, 
 I am Xi.
 this is my first time using github, it seems very interesting. Still a newbie in computer science world.
 Wish this is the start of truly understanding what I am doing or coding rather than just follow the instruction of every homework. Will explore more by myself, contribute to this platform and collaborate with others! 
 I am looking forward to work with u guys!
